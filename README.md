### Suggestion for how to implement right to erasure so that even past predictions are updated with the new short dataset

To implement "right to erasure" that includes re-scoring past predictions:

1. Maintain a log of all predictions, including input data, results, and model version used.
2. When records are erased, retrain the model without those records.
3. Create a "re-scoring pipeline" that:
    - Identifies past predictions potentially influenced by erased data
    - Re-runs these predictions through the new model
    - Updates the prediction log with new results
4. Implement a notification system to inform relevant parties of updated predictions.
5. Schedule this re-scoring process to run automatically when the erasure list is updated.

This approach ensures that not only future predictions, but also past ones, comply with the right to erasure, maintaining data privacy and model integrity.
