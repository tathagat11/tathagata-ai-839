## Ethical Considerations
- Decisions based on this model's output should be explainable and challengeable.
- The model should be used in compliance with relevant financial regulations and data protection laws.

## Caveats and Recommendations
- The model's performance may vary for different subgroups. It's recommended to evaluate the model's fairness across various demographic groups.
- Regular retraining is advised to ensure the model remains accurate as financial trends evolve.
- The model should be used in conjunction with other risk assessment methods and human judgment.
