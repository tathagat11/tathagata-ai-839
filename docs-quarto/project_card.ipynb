    "Financial institutions face significant challenges in assessing credit risk for loan applications. Traditional credit scoring methods often miss nuanced patterns and can be biased against certain demographic groups. This leads to both missed opportunities for good borrowers being denied and increased risk from bad loans being approved. In today's competitive banking environment, institutions need more sophisticated ways to evaluate credit applications while maintaining regulatory compliance and fairness."
